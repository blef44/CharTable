A simple character table.

Developped by Efflam using Windows Forms, in C#.

Open the projet (*CharTable.sln*) with Visual Studio to build and debug.

You can use the link to *CharTable.exe* to test the release build.

Click on a character to copy it in your clipboard, you can then paste it with Ctrl+V.

The characters are special letters, ponctuations and math signs that are usefull but missing on the french keyboard (azerty).
For other keyboards or uses, you can configure the character list in *Form1.cs*.
